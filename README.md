## Important! When using! ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹
Since View is not designed to write data to the database, I have added some functions that will add data to the database just for demonstration. If you want to use this View, delete the lines marked with the comment "start Block ONLY FOR A TEST" and "end Block ONLY FOR A TEST" and the extension marked "Test Data ONLY FOR A TEST" in the file /chart-view-swiftui/ViewModel/ChartViewModel
You can also delete the file chart-view-swiftui/Realm/TestData
